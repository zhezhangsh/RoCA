**Introduction: ** This analysis applies the Bioconductor ***[SVA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/sva.html)*** (Surrogate Variable Analysis) package and other methods to evaluate and adjust for known or unknown batch effect. It includes the following steps:

  - This analysis requires an original data matrix and sample description with one or multiple features, and parameters including
    * One or multiple features as variable(s) of interest
    * Zero or one feature known to be the source of batch effect
    * The number of surrogate variables (default=5) to be identified from the data matrix
  - The _sva_ function will first identify the given number of surrogate variables, each accounting for a portion of the total data variation. These surrogate variables will be evaluated as below. 
    * The association between each sample feature and each surrogate variable will be evaluated by ANOVA (categoral feature) or Pearson's correlation (numeric feature)
    * By grouping samples according variable(s) of interest, 2 sets of 1-way ANOVA p values, using the data matrix and the matrix adjusted for all surrogate variables, will be compared to evaluate whether removing potential batch effect will improve the signal/noise ratio in the data set. 
  - A new data matrix will be generated after adjusting for batch effect. 
    * If a sample feature is known to be the source of batch effect, the original matrix will be adjusted for it using  ***[ComBat](combat batch effect correction)*** (categoral variable) or ***[limma](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limma/)*** (continuous variable). It will be adjusted for all surrogate variables instead otherwise.
    * Same as the last step, the impact of data adjustment will be evaluated with 1-way ANOVA of samples grouped by variable(s) of interest.
  - An extra step will be carried out to adjust the original data matrix for all sample features and surrogate variables one by one, and evaluate the consequence.

# Description

## Project


Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. (**[GSE67426](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67426)**)

Jouffe C, Gobet C, Martin E, MÃ©tairon S et al. Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. Sci Rep 2016 Apr 21;6:24631. PMID: [27097688](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097688).


## Experimental design


Comparison of liver mRNA expression from Scp2 KO and wild-type mice harvested every 2 hours during 3 consecutive days.


## Analysis


This analysis evaluates the potential batch effect of different days, a sample feature named ***Replicate***, on which the mice were harvested. Only the wildtype mice and a subset of genes with high between sample variance were used for demonstration.

# Samples and variable(s) of interest



A total of 36 samples and 3 sample features was provided by the input data. Click [here](html/sample.html) to see a full list of samples and samples features.

# Identification and evaluation of surrogate variables 



The _sva()_ function was used to identify  surrogate variables from the original data matrix. Each surrogate variable is responsible for part of the overall data variation, and may or may not be related to known sample features, such as any variables of interest or experiment batch. Since each sample was assigned a value of each surrogate variable by the _sva_ function, these values were used to evaluate the association between surrogate variables and sample features using ANOVA for categoral variables or Pearson's correlation for numeric variables.

<div style="color:darkblue; padding:0 2cm">
**Table 2** ANOVA p value for the association between surrogate variables and sample features. 
</div>

<div align='center', style="padding:0 1cm">


|          | SV1  | SV2  |  SV3  |   SV4   | SV5  |
|:---------|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:----:|
|Group     | 0.55 | 0.50 | 0.800 | 7.0e-01 | 0.94 |
|Replicate | 0.11 | 0.05 | 0.032 | 8.5e-05 | 0.96 |
|Hour      | 0.89 | 0.77 | 0.100 | 3.4e-01 | 0.96 |


</div>

The _f.pvalue()_ function was used to run ANOVA tests using the variable(s) of interest and original data matrix, so each gene got an ANOVA p value. The test was then run again after adjusting the data matrix for surrogate variables that were not significantly associated with the surrogate variables (p < 0.01). The goal is to evaluate if the global statistical power was improved after the confounding effect of surrogate variables was removed.

# Adjust data for batch effect



Since sample feature, _Replicate_, was known to cause batch effect in the data, the original data matrix was then adjusted to remove its effect using the [_ComBat_](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/1/118.abstract) method if it is a categoral variable or the limma method if it is a numerical variable

# Evaluate all variables

Finally, the confounding or batch effect of all sample features and surrogate variables was evaluated one by one, after removing it from the original data matrix.

**Figure 3.** After adjusting the original data for each of the sample features or surrogate variables, ANOVA p values were calculated again for each gene. The numbers of significant genes obtaining from each adjusted data matrix were compared to the numbers of genes obtained from the original matrix.
