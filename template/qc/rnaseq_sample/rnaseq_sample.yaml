# Prepare the following data objects in text, Excel or R files to run this analysis
# <count> one or more data matrixes in .txt, .tab, .csv, .xlxs, .xls, .rdata, .rda, or .rds files
#   - each cell is the number of sequence reads of each sample mapped to each gene
#   - the first matrix will be used for the most of the analyses
#     - each of the other matrixes corresponds to reads with a different mapping type, such as reads mapped to multiple genes
#   - the column names of all matrixes are the matching unique gene IDs or symbols
#   - the row names of all matrixes are the matching unique sample IDs or symbols
# <annotation> a table saved in a .txt, .tab, .csv, .xlxs, .xls, .rdata, .rda, or .rds file
#   - the column names are unique gene IDs or symbols matching the row names of <count>
#   - must include a column for the chromosome each gene is located in
#   - muse include a column for the average length (of multiple alternative transcripts) of each gene
# <sample> a table saved in a .txt, .tab, .csv, .xlxs, .xls, .rdata, .rda, or .rds
#   - the column names are unique sample IDs or names matching column names of <count>
#   - each column corresponds to a sample feature that will be used to group samples in the analysis

# Analyst describes the analysis to run, such as project title
description:    
  Project: "Transcriptome of mouse brain tumors"
  Data: "RNA-seq data was generated from of 2 types of mouse brain tumors. Some tumors are tested for drug response.
        Raw data was processed to get gene-level read counts."
  Analysis: "This is a demo."
