  Project: Comparison between drug sensitive and resistant mouse tumors
  Analysis: This analysis compares drug resistant tumors from the same mouse. More
    specifically, there were 2 tumors from mouse J162-1 and 3 from mouse J6-0. Tumors
    from the same mouse were compared to each other via a 1-on-1 comparison. Additionally,
    J6-0-T1 was compared to J6-0-T2 and J6-0-T3 combined as T2 and T3 showed very
    similar global patterns. Differential expression between samples were evaluated
    by the [edgeR](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796818) method. The
    top ranked genes were further analyzed by gene set over- representation analysis.
