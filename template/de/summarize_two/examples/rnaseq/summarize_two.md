**Introduction**: This analysis is based on the outputs of pairwise comparisons of differential gene expression generated by [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/template/de/pairwise_comparison/pairwise_comparison.Rmd) template. It uses results from 3 pairwise comparisons of 3 sample groups vs. their corresponding control groups and compares how these 3 sample groups are different from each other in terms of their sample-control differences (_delta-delta_). An example of such analysis is the different responses of 3 cell types to the treatment of the same drug. This analysis is focused on the overlapping of differentially expression at both gene and gene set levels.

# Description
  
## Project


Transcriptome in immune cells of control-patient samples


## Data


Rna-seq data was generated from of 2 types of immune cells of 3 controls and 3 patients. Raw data was processed to get gene-level read counts. Pairwise comparisons were performed between controls and patients in each immune cell.


## Analysis


This is a demo.



## Pairwise comparisons

This report compares the results of the  following pairwise comparisons.
