# Description of this analysis, could be any name/text pairs
description: 
  Project: Comparison between cell lines from 9 different cancer tissues (NCI-60); **[GSE5949](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5949)**
  PubMed: "Reinhold WC, Reimers MA, Lorenzi P, Ho J et al. **Multifactorial regulation of E-cadherin expression: an integrative study.**
          Mol Cancer Ther 2010 Jan;9(1):1-16. PMID: [20053763](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20053763)."
  Experimental design: Comparison between cell lines from 9 different cancer tissue of origin types 
          (Breast, Central Nervous System, Colon, Leukemia, Melanoma, Non-Small Cell Lung, Ovarian, Prostate, Renal) from NCI-60 panel
  Analysis: Cluster genes co-expressed acroo 9 tissues/organs
          As a demonstration, only a subset of genes in the original data with high between sample variance were used.

##### INPUT DATA #####
######################
# Prepared input data, saved in .rds format using the saveRDS() function
input: # Location of input files
  data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/NCI60/expr_ss.rds     ## a matrix of data, row=gene, column=sample 
    # The order of the samples in the matrix matters, order them based on the order of the groups
    # It's optional to rescale the data matrix to make the mean and SD of rows comparable to each other, or normalize the data on the fly
    # No missing values allowed, remove rows with missing values or run imputation if estimate missing values
  annotation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/NCI60/anno.rds  ## a data frame of gene annotation 
    # Row names match the row names of the data matrix
    # First column should be official gene symbol
  sample: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/NCI60/sample.rds    ## a data frame of sample manifest
    # Row names match the column names of the data matrix
    # One column (specify it in parameter:term) should be the variable of interest that will classify samples into multiple groups
    # Order the samples the way you want to show them in the output
  geneset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gene.set/human.rds     ## collection of gene sets, availble online
    # the first is metadata of gene sets, 
    # the second is a list of gene set-gene mapping
    # refer to the rchive (github.com/zhezhangsh/rchive) repo for how to create a gene set collection

##### PARAMETERS #####
######################
# Parameters to run this analysis
parameter: # All parameters
  term: Organ             ## Corresponding to a column name in sample; based on which samples will be grouped
  normalization:          ## Optional re-normalization of data to let genes havign comparable means and SDs
    method: 1         ### Method of normalization. 0: no normalization; 1: mean=0 & SD=1 for all row;  2: normalize to a control group
    control:          ### Name of the control group. When the normalization method is 2, the mean of this sample group will be 0 for all genes
  selection:              ## How significant genes will be selected as seeds for initiating clusters
    min: 200          ### Minimal number of genes for further selection (no further selection if number is lower than it)
    max: 1000         ### Maximum number of genes to be selected

  cluster:                ## How initial clusters will be generated
    height: 1.2     ### The height to cut clustering tree. Lower value generates more clusters
    size: 0.20      ### The minimum size of a cluster (relative ratio to expected size)
    corr: 0.60      ### The minimum correlation coefficient to the cluster centroid for a gene to be kept in the cluster
    merge:          ### How to merge similar clusters
      corr: 0.65  #### The minimum correlation coefficient between 2 centroids to merge two clusters
      p: 0.01     #### The maximum p value between 2 centroids to merge two clusters
  recluster:              ## How to refine clusters via reclustering cycles
    p: 0.01         ### Maximum ANOVA p value to include a gene
    r: 0.60         ### Minimum correlation coefficient between a gene and centroid to inlude a gene in the cluster
    diff: 0.10      ### Minimum correlation coefficient difference between and best and the second best
