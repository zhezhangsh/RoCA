# To run this analysis, prepare the following R data objects and save them as .Rds files
# Use the readRDS() function to load examples
#   1. An R matrix with each sample as a column and each gene as a row. The row names must be NCBI gene IDs.
#       Preferably, the data has be normalized between samples and log-transformed for gene-gene correlation.
#   2. An R data.frame with row names matching the data matrix each sample feature as a column and each sample as a row. 
#       The row names must match the column names in the data matrix and each column provides extra annotation
#       information, such as official gene symbol and type of gene. URL links can be added to the values with the <a> tag.
#   3. An R data.frame of samples with row names matching column names of the data matrix. One column name
#       of this data.frame, specified in the parameter:term field,  will be used to group samples
#   4. An archive of predefined gene sets, such as KEGG pathways and Gene ontology terms, collected from different
#       resources, such as NCBI BioSystems and KEGG. Prepared collections for several species can be downloaded from:
#       https://github.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/tree/master/data/gene.set. Load an example to see how to prepare your own.

  Project: Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein
          2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. (**[GSE67426](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67426)**)
  PubMed: "Jouffe C, Gobet C, Martin E, MÃ©tairon S et al. Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways 
          in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. 
          Sci Rep 2016 Apr 21;6:24631. PMID: [27097688](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097688)."
  Experimental design: Comparison of liver mRNA expression from Scp2 KO and wild-type mice harvested every 
          2 hours during 3 consecutive days.
  Analysis: Circadian rhythm in mouse liver, wild type mice only, 3 replicates every 2 hours (12 groups).
          Each gene was adjusted to its 0 hour mean and rescaled to make its standard deviation equal to 0.

##### INPUT DATA #####
######################
# Prepared input data, saved in .rds format using the saveRDS() function
input: # Location of input files
  data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/circadian_rhythm/expr_wt.rds        ## a matrix of data, row=gene, column=sample 
    # The order of the samples in the matrix matters, order them based on the order of the groups
    # It's optional to rescale the data matrix to make the mean and SD of rows comparable to each other, or normalize the data on the fly
    # No missing values allowed, remove rows with missing values or run imputation if estimate missing values
  annotation: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/circadian_rhythm/anno.rds     ## a data frame of gene annotation 
    # Row names match the row names of the data matrix
    # First column should be official gene symbol
  sample: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gex/circadian_rhythm/sample_wt.rds    ## a data frame of sample manifest
    # Row names match the column names of the data matrix
    # One column (specify it in parameter:term) should be the variable of interest that will classify samples into multiple groups
    # Order the samples the way you want to show them in the output
  geneset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/master/data/gene.set/mouse.rds                   ## collection of gene sets, availble online
    # the first is metadata of gene sets, 
    # the second is a list of gene set-gene mapping
