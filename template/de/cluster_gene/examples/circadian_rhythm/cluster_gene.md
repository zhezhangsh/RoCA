**Introduction: ** This procedure performs a gene-gene clustering analysis that will identify clusters co-expressed genes across multiple sample groups. It first runs an ANOVA to find genes significantly changed across sample groups and uses these genes to initiate a few gene clusters. The clusters will be refined based on several user-specific paramters. Gene set enrichment analysis will be used to assign biological functionality to the finalized gene clusters. 

  - **Selection of differentially expressed gene:** ANOVA is used to get each gene a p value 
    for its differential expression across sample groups and corresponding false discovery rate 
    was calculated using the p values. Seed genes for clustering are sequentially selected by FDR, 
    p value, and range until the number of selected genes is smaller than a given minimal number.
  - **Gene clustering analysis:** The _hclust{stat}_ function is used to generate hierchical 
    clustering tree from the seed genes; the tree is cut at a given height to get initial clusters;
    the cutting height is lowered to get more clusters if the number of clusters is less than the 
    number of sample groups; the initial clusters are filtered to remove small and outlier genes; 
    initial clusters close to each other are merged; and finally, the clusters are refined through 
    multiple rounds of re-clustering while including genes with less significant ANOVA p values. 
  - **Gene set enrichment analysis:** Hypergeometric test is used to find predefined gene sets over-
    represented in each gene cluster. A collection of gene sets of different species from different 
    sources can be found at https://github.com/zhezhangsh/RoCA/tree/master/data.

# Description

## Project


Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. (**[GSE67426](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67426)**)

Jouffe C, Gobet C, Martin E, MÃ©tairon S et al. Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. Sci Rep 2016 Apr 21;6:24631. PMID: [27097688](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097688).


## Experimental design


Comparison of liver mRNA expression from Scp2 KO and wild-type mice harvested every 2 hours during 3 consecutive days.


## Analysis


Circadian rhythm in mouse liver, wild type mice only, 3 replicates every 2 hours (12 groups). Each gene was adjusted to its 0 hour mean and rescaled to make its standard deviation equal to 0.

## Data and samples



  - There are 12065 total genes
  - There are 36 total [samples](table/sample.html)
  - There are WT_00Hr, WT_02Hr, WT_04Hr, WT_06Hr, WT_08Hr, WT_10Hr, WT_12Hr, WT_14Hr, WT_16Hr, WT_18Hr, WT_20Hr, WT_22Hr sample groups

The input data matrix was normalized using sample group _WT_00Hr_ as control, so, the data of each gene was substracted by control group mean and had SD equal to 1.0

## Identification of gene clusters

### Selection of differentially expressed genes

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected as seeds for generating gene clusters, using the following criteria:
  
  - Select genes with FDR less than 0.2
  - Stop if less than 200 genes were left; otherwise, select those with ANOVA p values less than 0.01
  - Stop if less than 200 genes were left; otherwise, select those with range (_max-min_) greater than 1
  - If there are still more than 2000 genes left, select the top 2000 with the biggest ranges



A total of **1175** genes were selected. These genes would be used as seeds to generate gene clusters in the next step.

### Idetnfication of gene clusters

Gene clusters were identified from the DEG seeds with the following steps:
  
  - Create a hierchical tree based on gene-gene correlation
  - Cut the tree at height 1.2, which will classify genes into clusters. Then apply the following steps to refine the clusters
  - Calculate correlation of each gene to the centroid (median) of its cluster. Remove the genes if the correlation is less than 0.6
  - Remove clusters with size less than 20% of the expected size (the expected size is 50 if there are 500 genes and 10 clusters)
  - If there are less than 12 (the number of sample groups) clusters left, reduce the height cutoff by 0.05 and repeat this step until there are enough clusters
  - Merge the 2 most similar clusters if the correlation of their centroids is greater than or equal to 0.6. Repeat this step until no 2 clusters are that similar



**6** gene clusters of **948** genes were identified from **1175** seed DEGs.

### Refinement of gene clusters



The gene clusters identified from the DEG seeds were further refined with the following steps: 

  - Select all 1469 genes with p values less than 0.02 to continue
  - Assign selected genes to clusters:
  - Calculate centroid (median expression level of all genes in the cluster) of each cluster
  - Calculate correlation coefficient of each gene to centroid of each cluster to get a 1469 X 6 matrix
  - Assign a gene to a cluster if its correlation coefficient to the cluster is greater than 0.6, and the correlation coefficient to any other cluster is at least 0.1 less
  - Repeat this reclustering steps for 20 times unless the reclustering converged
  - Finally, remove clusters with number of genes less than 31.6
  
The reclustering converged after 18 cycles

A total of **867** genes were clustered after refinement.
