**Introduction: ** This analysis performs a gene-gene clustering procedure that will identify clusters of co-expressed genes across multiple sample groups. It first runs an ANOVA to find genes significantly changed across sample groups and uses these genes as seeds to initiate a number of gene clusters. These clusters will be further refined based on several user-specific paramters. Gene set enrichment analysis is then used to find pre-defined gene sets that are over-represented in each cluster. 

  - **Selection of differentially expressed gene:** ANOVA is used to get each gene a p value 
    for its differential expression across sample groups and false discovery rates are calculated      using the p values. Afterwards, genes are filtered sequentially by their FDR, p value, and         range until the number of remaining genes is smaller than a given minimal number.
  - **Gene clustering analysis:** Remaining genes from the last step are used as seeds for the         _hclust{stat}_ function to generate a hierchical clustering tree; the tree is cut at a given       height to get initial clusters; the cutting height will be lowered if the number of clusters is     less than the number of sample groups; the initial clusters are filtered to remove small           clusters, and refined to remove outlier genes; initial clusters close to each other are merged;     and finally, the clusters are refined through multiple rounds of re-clustering while including     genes with less significant ANOVA p values. 
  - **Gene set enrichment analysis:** Hypergeometric test is used to find predefined gene sets         over-represented in each gene cluster. A collection of gene sets obtained from                     different sources are available for a few model species and can be found at

# Description

## Project


Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. (**[GSE67426](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67426)**)

Jouffe C, Gobet C, Martin E, MÃ©tairon S et al. Perturbed rhythmic activation of signaling pathways in mice deficient for Sterol Carrier Protein 2-dependent diurnal lipid transport and metabolism. Sci Rep 2016 Apr 21;6:24631. PMID: [27097688](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097688).


## Experimental design


Comparison of liver mRNA expression from Scp2 KO and wild-type mice harvested every 2 hours during 3 consecutive days.


## Analysis


Circadian rhythm in mouse liver, wild type mice only, 3 replicates every 2 hours (12 groups). Each gene was adjusted to its 0 hour mean and rescaled to make its standard deviation equal to 0.

## Data and samples



  - There are 12065 total genes
  - There are 36 total [samples](table/sample.html)
  - There are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 sample groups

The input data matrix was normalized using sample group _WT_00Hr_ as control, so, the data of each gene was substracted by control group mean and had SD equal to 1.0
